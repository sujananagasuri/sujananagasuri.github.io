The checklist is very difficult for expert users to fill out while also conducting an Unboxing and Setup experience of a new printer. The 500 questions needed copy updates and content revisions along with alignment with target user experiences. Additionally, expert users rarely if ever utilized it because of the length of the checklist and the fact that there was no way to efficiently process the data. </p>

                Overall, this internship was a very fun 12 week experience that quickly taught me to get comfortable with the uncomfortable. I didn’t know a whole lot about print design going in so learning on the job (and fast) became a crucial factor to my success. Throughout the process, I learned a lot not just about interaction design but also about project management, working on a cross-functional team with people across many different time zones and corporate company culture. I plan on refining these important skills throughout my career.
