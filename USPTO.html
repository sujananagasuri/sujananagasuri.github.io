                            <li>Right off the bat, my manager and I worked together to research and design a questionnaire that would help us pinpoint specific problems and issues our target users (employees of USPTO) were experiencing. </li>

                            <li>We conducted two focus groups, each of which had about 15 people from different sectors of USPTO. With the aid of my carefully constructed questionnaire and a roundtable style discussion I discovered the lack of connected employees felt due to the remote nature of the company.</li>
                            <li>This sense of disconnectedness was the main focus and drove all of the design decisions I made for the remainder of my externship.</li>

                        <ol>
                            <li>To help vitalize a sense of community within USPTO, I focused on redesigning three specific intranet pages: the Community Page, the employees features page, and the company updates newsletter.</li>
                            <li>I created low-fi and hi-fi prototypes for the employees features page and the company updates newsletter. After presenting to the teams who develop those pages, I was able to hand off to them. </li>
                            <li>With the community page, I was able to stay a little more involved beyond just the initial designs I had created as there was not a dedicated team working on the intranet community page. </li>
                        </ol>

                        <li>Based on the low-fi and hi-fi prototypes, I helped conduct 5+ usability sessions with managers of different teams within USPTO. These insights that we gathered were carefully organized and sorted into 5 different categories.</li>
                        <li>These 5 different categories were: navigation, colors + typography, newsfeed, upcoming events, resources (internal + external), and posting announcements.</li>
                        <li>The insights generated from user testing were placed into one of 5 categories and changes to the prototype were made accordingly.</li>
